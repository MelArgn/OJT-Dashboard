    **Analysis**  
    - **98% Tier (5 operators)**: Maintained perfect safety compliance and TSG scores â‰¥85%.  
    - **90â€“97% Tier (8 operators)**: Strong performance but require reinforcement in complex yard maneuvers.  
    - **83â€“89% Tier (9 operators)**: Struggle with concurrent tasks (avg 2.4 assists/run), requiring additional instructor-led drills.  
    - **Critical Divergence**: Operators with <50 hours of training score 19% lower on recovery operations than peers (*p<0.05*), affecting response time in emergency scenarios.

    - **Hour-Effectiveness Threshold**: 90+ hours required for 95% TSG compliance.  
    - Operators with 90+ hours of training exhibit higher proficiency in complex yard operations.  
    - Operators with <50 hours of training struggle with emergency recovery protocols, scoring 19% lower in related assessments.  
    - High variability in training exposure impacts TSG compliance, with those below 75% requiring additional supervised drills.  
    - **Yard Focus Advantage**: Martinez Randell achieved 97.8% readiness with 138 hours through precision yard training.

    - 92% positive feedback (Martinez Randell) correlates with 97.8% operational readiness.  
    - Neutral feedback primarily from non-critical task pauses (e.g., radio channel confirmation).

    - **Skill Stacking Requirement**  
      - Operators completing third-car recovery + weather preparedness achieve 94.6% operational readiness, reinforcing the need for combined training approaches.  
      - Isolated skill training results in only 83.1% readiness, highlighting the benefits of an integrated training curriculum.
    - **Resource Allocation**  
      - 7000-series simulator time reduces skill gaps 62% faster than classroom training, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating proficiency.
